# JMessenger
A messaging application built from scratch using java. The chat client is built for windows machine. I'm working on building a client for web. The server is headless(terminal based). Hence it can run on any machine as long the machine has JDK  22. 
Feel free to test. You'll need to compile them for now. I'll update the repository with a build later.
